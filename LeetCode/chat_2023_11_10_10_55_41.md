1. **You**: write code in python do fibanachi
2. **ChatGPT**: Sure! Here's a Python code to generate the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to nth term"""
    fib_seq = [0, 1]  # Initialize sequence with first two terms

    if n <= 0:
        return []  # Return an empty list for n <= 0
    elif n <= 2:
        return fib_seq[:n]  # Return the sequence as is for n <= 2

    for i in range(2, n):
        next_term = fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2]  # Calculate the next term
        fib_seq.append(next_term)  # Append the next term to the sequence

    return fib_seq

# Usage example
n = 10
fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)
print(fib_sequence)
```

This code defines a function called `fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` as input. It initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two terms `[0, 1]`. Then, it uses a for loop to calculate the next terms of the sequence and appends them to the list. Finally, it returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

In the usage example, `n` is set to `10` to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term. The result is then printed.

Output:
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

This code can be easily modified to generate the Fibonacci sequence with different lengths by changing the value of `n`.
